1. Patents are always bad

2. A patent is a claim that your allegations trump my ability to
use my own property

http://www.stephankinsella.com/2009/11/rand-on-ip-owning-values-and-rearrangement-rights/
> In Jeff Tucker’s superb article If You Believe in IP, How Do You Teach
> Others?, he notes Rand’s increasing focus on exalting the creator and
> elevating “intellectual rights” to such a height that they totally trump
> real rights. This is no exaggeration. As I noted in Against Intellectual
> Property, Rand actually, incredibly said that “patents are the heart
> and core of property rights.” See also my post Inventors are Like
> Unto …. GODS….., noting Objectivist IP attorney Murray Franck approvingly
> repeating this quote: “intellectual property is after all the only absolute
> possession in the world.”

3. A patent is a cheque drawn against, or a bargain with, the public

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=574141
> The metaphor of the patent bargain, the notion that a patent represents the grant
> of the right of exclusivity in exchange for the disclosure of a novel invention, is
> generally accepted among the members of the patent law community.

4. Patents are intended to decrease the supply and increase the
price of goods. If the Green Party consider that this establishment
of inequality is a good thing then I will not be able to persuade you
otherwise. I doubt that even Socrates could.

5. Consider patent trolls

> Any software company that you start can be shut down by somebody else that

> distracts companies that are working for my benefit and if delays
> release of new products. We the society could be moving much faster
> without these distractions.

6. Consider the Boulton and Watt Patent

http://mises.org/library/james-watt-monopolist
> In fact, it is only after their patents expired that Boulton and Watt really started to
> manufacture steam engines. Before then their activity consisted primarily of extracting
> hefty monopolistic royalties through licensing. Independent contractors produced most of
> the parts, and Boulton and Watt merely oversaw the assembly of the components by the
> purchasers.

> In most histories, James Watt is a heroic inventor, responsible for the beginning of
> the Industrial Revolution. The facts suggest an alternative interpretation. Watt is one
> of many clever inventors working to improve steam power in the second half of the
> eighteenth century. After getting one step ahead of the pack, he remained ahead not
> by superior innovation, but by superior exploitation of the legal system. The fact that
> his business partner was a wealthy man with strong connections in Parliament, was
> not a minor help.

> Was Watt's patent a crucial incentive needed to trigger his inventive genius, as the
> traditional history suggests? Or did his use of the legal system to inhibit competition
> set back the industrial revolution by a decade or two? More broadly, are the two
> essential components of our current system of intellectual property — patents and
> copyrights — with all of their many faults, a necessary evil we must put up with to
> enjoy the fruits of invention and creativity? Or are they just unnecessary evils, the
> relics of an earlier time when governments routinely granted monopolies to favored
> courtiers?

7. Consider the Sewing Machine patent

http://volokh.com/posts/chain_1240849478.shtml
> The typical story of the Sewing Machine War is that the incremental invention of the
> sewing machine through complementary contributions by differing inventors now came to
> its full fruition with a litany of patent infringement lawsuits. However, Howe and Singer
> may have had something to do with this descent into full-scale legal warfare with their
> public announcement of the settlement of their "long and protracted legal controversy."
> In the August 12, 1854 issue of the Scientific American, for instance, they concluded
> their settlement announcement with the following dire warning: "We caution the public
> against buying any of the numerous infringer machines in the market. They all infringe
> one, and some of them several, of our patents, and those who attempt to use them will
> be prosecuted."

> With Howe and Singer assuming this very aggressive litigation stance — now standing

> sewing machine manufacturers soon let loose a flurry of their own lawsuits. As
> one historian has observed, after Howe and Singer concluded their dispute, "all
> the sewing machine manufacturers got busily down to the job of suing each other
> out of existence.

8. Consider the telephone patent

http://www.telcomhistory.org/vm/sciencePatentFollies.shtml
> It’s February 14, 1876. Valentine’s Day, for those running about with a romantic bent.
> Nearly one hundred years after the US Declaration of Independence, for those of a more
> historical nature. If you had been in Boston, Massachusetts, that morning, loitering near
> the US Patent Office, you may have noticed a man rushing in to file for a patent. This
> wouldn’t have been Bell himself, but his attorney Marcellus Bailey, there to file for a
> patent entitled "Improvements in Telegraphy," and not mentioning the word “telephone.”

> Having nothing to do for a few hours, and finding yourself still loitering near the patent
> office, you would have seen another man, Elisha Gray, rushing in to file his
> Caveat, which announced his intention to file for a patent within three months, for
> “the art of transmitting vocal sounds or conversations telegraphically through an
> electric circuit.”

> It’s one of those moments in history that, if, say, Bell’s attorney had been slower, or
> busier, or had eaten a bit of bad fish and was ill that day, we’d be talking about the
> Gray telephone, the Gray System, and the eventual breakup of the Gray monopoly
> on telephony. And there’d be all sorts of terrible puns on his name (what color is
> your telephone? Gray, of course), and it wouldn’t fit so nicely with the ringing device
> on the phone (although the ringer for the phone wasn’t invented by Bell, it was
> invented by Watson, Bell’s assistant).

> Based on that few hours, Bell was granted the patent for the telephone and,
> despite around 600 lawsuits challenging his patent, he emerged as the man enshrined
> in all the history books (and with good reason, as we shall see). In fact, it wasn’t the
> few hours that were the basis of all those lawsuits; instead, the fact that the key to
> the telephone, variable resistance, was written in the margin of Bell’s application,
> as though added later (perhaps, it was claimed, after Bell had read Gray’s Caveat,
> which also included the principle), became a principle issue. Still, the courts
> consistently found in Bell’s favor.

> A lucky thing for Bell was that the patent office didn’t require a working model of
> the invention. This had been a requirement for any patent application all the way until
> 1870, but then, for whatever reason, it was dropped and a person could file for a patent
> with just a description of the invention.

9. Consider the microprocessor patent

http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/none/330368-the-birth-of-the-microprocessor
> The history of integrated circuits is one of further and further integration, so the idea
> that you could eventually put all the features you want into a "CPU on a chip"
> was certainly in the air by the end of the 1960's.

> Intel wasn't alone in recognizing the need for a general purpose processor, as there were
> too many customers who were wanting processors to design a custom chip for each
> of them.  Later Hoff and Noyce would write "If this continued…the number of
> circuits needed would proliferate beyond the number of circuit designers. At the
> same time, the relative usage of each circuit would fall….Increased design cost
> and diminished usage would prevent manufacturers from amortizing costs over a
> large user population and would cut off the advantages of the learning curve."

> "People had talked about a computer on a chip for years," Intel co-founder
> Gordon Moore said, "but it was always out there in the future. What Ted saw was
> that, with the complexity with which we were already working, you could actually
> make an integrated circuit like that now. That was the real conceptual breakthrough."

> And even Ted Hoff has sometimes downplayed the importance of the concept.
> "The actual invention of the microprocessor wasn't as important as simply
> appreciating that there was a market for such a thing."

> But there were other contenders for the title of first microprocessor. Texas
> Instruments actually announced a "CPU-on-a-chip" in April 1971, designed initially
> as a contract chip for Computer Terminal Corporation (later Datapoint). This apparently
> never worked, and in fact, Intel was working on a chip for CTC with the
> same specification; this was known as the 1201 and would eventually be renamed
> the 8008. Perhaps more importantly, by late 1971 Texas Instruments Engineer
> Gary Boone and Michael Cochrane produced the first prototype of an integrated
> circuit that included an input-output circuit, memory, and a central processor all in
> one chip, as opposed to the four-chip MCS-4 set. Known as the TMS1000, this was
> used initially in a TI calculator and became commercially available in 1974.
> Boone received a patent for his CPU in 1973, and later Boone and Cochran received
> a patent for a computer on a chip.

> Intel's patent attorney was skeptical of making large claims and resisted Hoff's desire
> to patent the work as a "computer" because it would be so complicated and
> because others had the concept of putting a computer on a chip. According to Hoff,
> "he said they weren't worth it and essentially he refused at that time to write a
> patent." Instead, they filed more specific and more limited patents. Intel received
> two patents: Hoff, Mazor, and Faggin received one on "the Memory System for
> a Multi-Chip Digital Computer," covering the external bus organization and the
> memory addressing scheme of the Intel MCS-4 chip set, while Faggin received
> one for a circuit that could reset the CPU when the power is
> turned on.

> Years later, inventor Gilbert Hyatt would be granted a patent on the
> microprocessor, which he filed in 1970, based on an invention he says
> he made in 1968 at his company Microcomputer Inc. But this doesn't appear
> to have been manufactured. Meanwhile, Fairchild, IBM, Signetics, Four-Phase,
> and RCA were also working on microprocessor-like devices. Still, the 4004 is
> almost universally considered the first microprocessor.

10. Inventions are not the result of one person's inventive activity, but
are a team operation. Further, inventions are not made "ex nihilo", but
are improvements upon pre-existing machines

11. You cannot make money copying someone else's product. This is the
"Mary  Gloster" position.

12. Tell me again why granting a monopoly on Version 1.0 stimulates its
inventor to make it out of date by creating Version 2.0. (The Green Party,
I take it, is a strong supporter of state-protected monopolies. The more
the merrier).

After reviewing these positive features of the Patent systen, please
also, consider its bad points.

1. Costly to enforce et cetera

2. Patent beneficiaries can be less than honest in their bargain
